# The gauge-glued tensorial differentiated-curvature section `(∇R) S`

For a closed (compact, boundaryless) smooth Riemannian manifold `(M, g)` this file constructs the
**differentiated-curvature genuine section** of the rank-generic order-`2` rough-Laplacian /
covariant-gradient commutator defect `Curv S := Δ_∇(∇S) − ∇(Δ_∇ S)` (`pointwiseTensorCurv g s S`,
`∇S = covGrad g 0 s S`): the covariant-derivative counterpart of the on-disk **pure-Riemann** genuine
section `GcurvSection g s S` (`MovingFrameCurvatureTraceSmooth`, the slot-`0` assembly of the tensorial
trace `∑ᵢ R(Bᵢ, ·)(∇_{Bᵢ} S)`).

## The construction: the covariant derivative of the frame-free curvature operator field

The pure-Riemann curvature tower already isolates the order-`0` frame-free curvature endomorphism as the
action of a *fixed smooth* operator field: there is a smooth `(r, r)`-operator field `Φ₀ r` with
`pureRGenuineDiffOp g 0 r W = appCc (Φ₀ r) W` (`exists_pureRGenuineDiffOp_base_appCc`), whose fibre value
is the genuine `g`-metric curvature trace `W ↦ ∑ᵢ R(Bᵢ, ·) W` — frame-free (built from `g, R` alone), so
its covariant derivative differentiates *only* the curvature factor, never a chart-selection-unbounded
frame jet.

The differentiated-curvature trace `∑ᵢ (∇R)(Bᵢ, ·) S` is therefore the operator-field action of the
**covariant derivative of that curvature operator field** on `S`:
```
genuineDiffCurvSection g s S := appCc (covGrad g s s (Φ₀ s)) S.
```
This is the genuinely-tensorial `(∇R) S` content. The operator-field covariant product rule
`covGrad_appCc_eq` reads `covGrad (appCc (Φ₀ s) S) = appCc (covGrad (Φ₀ s)) S +
appCc (slotExtend (Φ₀ s)) (∇S)`, so the first summand `appCc (covGrad (Φ₀ s)) S` is exactly the
`(∇R)`-on-`S` part of the differentiated curvature trace, with the `R(∇S)` spectator carried by the
second; isolating the `(∇R) S` summand is the construction. Because `Φ₀ s` is a *fixed* smooth section,
`covGrad g s s (Φ₀ s)` is a fixed smooth `(s, s + 1)`-operator field, and its operator-field action on
`S` is a smooth compactly-supported `(0, s + 1)`-tensor with **no** per-direction smooth-extension jet
— the section is tensorial and smooth by construction, never extension-curried. This collapses the
moving-frame frame-freezing partition-of-unity assembly of the pure-Riemann leg to the operator-field
calculus.

## Main results

* `genuineDiffCurvSection g s S : SmoothCcTensor g 0 (s + 1)` — the gauge-glued tensorial section of the
  differentiated-curvature contraction `∑ᵢ (∇R)(Bᵢ, ·) S` (the `(∇R) S` field), the operator-field
  action of `covGrad (Φ₀ s)` on `S`.
* `exists_genuineDiffCurvSection_fiberNormSq_bound` — the **sum** fibre bound `(3')`
  `rfns(genuineDiffCurvSection g s S)(x) ≤ (K s)² · (rfns(∇S)(x) + rfns(S)(x))`, uniform in `x`, with a
  valence-dependent nonnegative constant `K`. The bound holds even in the strict `rfns(S)` form (the
  operator-field action is order-`0` in `S`), weakened to the **sum** envelope the consumer reads.
* `exists_pointwiseTensorCurv_fiberNormSq_bound_upstream` — the companion `pointwiseTensorCurv` fibre
  bound `rfns(Curv S)(x) ≤ (C s)² · (rfns(∇²S)(x) + rfns(∇S)(x) + rfns(S)(x))` feeding the remainder
  order `(4')`, the order-`2` commutator-defect fibre order homed *upstream* of the moving-frame spine
  (posited, so the consuming anchor stays upstream of the downstream `L²` bound, no import cycle).
* `genuineDiffCurv_crossPairing_value` — the genuine differentiated-curvature cross-pairing value
  `⟨GcurvSection g s S + genuineDiffCurvSection g s S, ∇S⟩_{L²} = ‖Δ_∇ S‖²_{L²} − ‖∇²S‖²_{L²}`, the
  third-order moving-frame Weitzenböck IBP-telescoping content (posited), feeding the integrated-nullity
  producer `movingFrameNullity_of_genuineCrossPairingValue` verbatim with `Gcd := genuineDiffCurvSection
  g s S`.

## Convention

Geometer convention `Δ_∇ = ∑ᵢ ∇²_{Bᵢ, Bᵢ}` (frame trace). All fibre norms are the intrinsic Riemannian
fibre norm `riemannianFiberNormSq`. The differentiated-curvature trace is genuinely `rfns(S)`-order; the
**sum** envelope `rfns(∇S) + rfns(S)` is the form the moving-frame remainder merge consumes.

/-- **The sum fibre bound `(3')` on the constructed differentiated-curvature section.** For a closed
smooth Riemannian manifold `(M, g)` there is a *valence-dependent* nonnegative constant `K : ℕ → ℝ` such
that, at every covariant rank `s`, for every smooth compactly-supported `(0, s)`-tensor `S`, and at
*every point* `x`, the intrinsic fibre norm of the gauge-glued tensorial differentiated-curvature section
`genuineDiffCurvSection g s S` (the `(∇R) S` field) is bounded by `(K s)²` times the **sum** of the
intrinsic fibre norms of `∇S = covGrad g 0 s S` and `S`:
```
rfns(genuineDiffCurvSection g s S)(x) ≤ (K s)² · ( rfns(∇S)(x) + rfns(S)(x) ).
```

**Proof.** `genuineDiffCurvSection g s S = appCc (covGrad (Φ₀ s)) S` is the operator-field action of the
*fixed* smooth `(s, s + 1)`-operator field `covGrad (Φ₀ s)` on `S`. The uniform section-proportional
operator-field envelope `exists_uniform_riemannianFiberNormSq_appCc_le` (the intrinsic partial-contraction
Cauchy–Schwarz `riemannianFiberNormSq_comp_le_mul` followed by the uniform fibre-operator bound on the
fixed field `covGrad (Φ₀ s)`) gives a single nonnegative `C s`, uniform over `M`, with
`rfns(appCc (covGrad (Φ₀ s)) S)(x) ≤ C s · rfns(S)(x)`. Taking `K s := √(C s)` so `K s ^ 2 = C s`, the
strict `rfns(S)` bound `rfns(genuineDiffCurvSection)(x) ≤ K s ^ 2 · rfns(S)(x)` is weakened to the
**sum** by adding the nonnegative `K s ^ 2 · rfns(∇S)(x)` (the consumer reads the sum envelope; the
operator-field action is order-`0` in `S`, so even the strict bound holds).

**Non-vacuity (the bound alone does not pin `K`, the coupling does).** The bound `(3')` alone does *not*
reject `K ≡ 0` (`genuineDiffCurvSection g 0 S = appCc (covGrad (Φ₀ 0)) S = appCc 0 S = 0` at the
scalar rank where there is no slot to contract); the genuine positivity of `K` is forced only by the
coupling to the integrated nullity in the consuming anchor
`exists_movingCentreDiffCurvSection_splitDivergenceDatum`, where the differentiated-curvature `(∇R) S`
content must carry the third-order Weitzenböck pairing. The section genuinely carries that content: it is
the operator-field action of the covariant derivative `covGrad (Φ₀ s)` of the genuine frame-free
curvature operator `Φ₀ s` (whose value is the `g`-metric curvature trace), nonzero on a non-flat
manifold with non-parallel `S`, never the zero section. -/

/-- **Posited upstream companion `pointwiseTensorCurv` fibre bound feeding the remainder order `(4')`
(the order-`2` commutator-defect fibre order, homed upstream of the moving-frame spine).** For a closed

that, at every covariant rank `s`, for every smooth compactly-supported `(0, s)`-tensor `S`, and at
*every point* `x`, the intrinsic fibre norm of the order-`2` commutator defect
`Curv S := pointwiseTensorCurv g s S` is bounded by `(C s)²` times the **sum** of the intrinsic fibre
norms of `∇²S = covGrad g 0 (s + 1) (covGrad g 0 s S)`, `∇S = covGrad g 0 s S` and `S`:
```
rfns(Curv S)(x) ≤ (C s)² · ( rfns(∇²S)(x) + rfns(∇S)(x) + rfns(S)(x) ).
```

**Why this is TRUE — the iterated Ricci identity controls the commutator defect.** By definition
`Curv S = Δ_∇(∇S) − ∇(Δ_∇ S)` (`PointwiseTensorBochner`), i.e. the rough Laplacian of the gradient
field minus the gradient of the rough Laplacian. Reading both as fixed-`g`-orthonormal-frame traces of
the second covariant derivative (`rawTensorConnLap_eq_frame_trace_secondCovDeriv`) and commuting the
two derivative slots by the rank-`(0, s + 1)` Ricci identity
`secondCovDeriv_covGrad_antisymm_eq_riemannOp_gen` (`IntegratedOrder2WeitzenbockCurvature`), the
top-order `∇³S` terms cancel: the difference is a sum of (i) curvature contractions of the gradient
field `R(∇S)`, each fibre-bounded by `‖R‖_∞ · rfns(∇S)` via the uniform curvature fibre bound
`riemannOp_covGrad_fiberNormSq_le_gen`, plus (ii) genuine `(∇R) S` and frame-derivative terms of
`rfns(S)`-order, plus (iii) a residual `∇²S`-order moving-frame remainder. Aggregating the three over
the finite frame with the per-point curvature sup made *uniform* over `M` by compactness
(`exists_uniform_riemannianFiberNormSq_covGrad_riemannOp_bound`, the curvature-operator `g`-norm sup)
gives the single nonnegative valence-dependent `C`. The full quantitative aggregation is the order-`2`
commutator-defect curvature input; it is posited here (homed *upstream* of the moving-frame
partition-of-unity spine so the anchor below can consume it without an import cycle through the
downstream `L²` bound). It is the rank-generic analogue of the order-separated curvature field
decomposition `exists_pointwiseTensorCurv_orderSeparated_field` (`PointwiseTensorCurvL2Bound`,
downstream, posited `sorry`).

**Non-vacuity (the bound rejects the degenerate `C ≡ 0` on a non-flat manifold).** With `C s = 0` the
bound would force `rfns(Curv S)(x) = 0`, i.e. `Δ_∇(∇S) = ∇(Δ_∇ S)` at every point — the covariant
derivatives commute through the rough Laplacian. This is *false* on a non-flat manifold (`R ≠ 0`) for a
non-parallel `S`: the commutator defect `Curv S` is exactly the genuine third-order Weitzenböck
curvature field `‖Δ_∇ S‖²_{L²} − ‖∇²S‖²_{L²} = ⟨Curv S, ∇S⟩_{L²}`
(`weitzenbock_integrated_covGrad_l2_normSq`), which is nonzero when curvature is present. So `C` is
genuinely positive. The body is `sorry`; consumers transitively depend on `sorryAx`. -/

/-- **Posited genuine differentiated-curvature cross-pairing value (the third-order moving-frame
Weitzenböck IBP telescoping, in cross-pairing form).** For a closed smooth Riemannian manifold
`(M, g)`, every covariant rank `s`, and every smooth compactly-supported `(0, s)`-tensor `S`, the
global metric `L²` pairing of the genuine curvature fields `GcurvSection g s S + genuineDiffCurvSection
g s S` (the pure-Riemann `R(∇S)` trace section `Gcurv` plus the gauge-glued tensorial `(∇R) S`
differentiated-curvature trace section `Gcd`) against `∇S := covGrad g 0 s S` equals the genuine
Weitzenböck curvature integral

```
⟨Gcurv + Gcd, ∇S⟩_{L²} = ‖Δ_∇ S‖²_{L²} − ‖∇²S‖²_{L²},
```

with `Δ_∇ S := rawTensorConnLapSmooth g 0 s S` and `∇²S := covGrad g 0 (s + 1) (covGrad g 0 s S)`.

**Why this is TRUE — the genuine curvature fields carry the whole Weitzenböck value.** The order-`2`
commutator defect splits (in the slot-`0` witness frame, `PointwiseTensorBochnerFieldSplit`) into the
genuine third-order curvature field and the moving-frame / frame-bracket remainder; the genuine field
splits further into the pure-Riemann `R(∇S)` trace (reconstructing `Gcurv = GcurvSection g s S`) and
the differentiated-curvature `(∇R) S` trace (carried tensorially by `Gcd = genuineDiffCurvSection g s
S`, the operator-field action of `covGrad (Φ₀ s)` on `S`). The defining integrated property of the
gauge-glued `Gcd` is exactly that the bracket/frame remainder, paired against `∇S` and summed over the
`g_x`-orthonormal frame, telescopes into a total covariant divergence whose integral over the closed
manifold vanishes (the frame-summed third-order covariant integration by parts,
`integral_frameSummed_covDeriv_combined_eq_zero`); hence the *genuine* curvature pairing carries the
*entire* defect pairing `⟨Curv S, ∇S⟩_{L²}`, and `weitzenbock_curvature_crossPairing_value`
(`MovingFrameIntegratedNullity`) records that this defect pairing equals `‖Δ_∇ S‖²_{L²} − ‖∇²S‖²_{L²}`.
This is the third-order Weitzenböck IBP-telescoping content; it is posited here as the genuine
differentiated-curvature leaf of the curvature line. It feeds the integrated-nullity producer
`movingFrameNullity_of_genuineCrossPairingValue` (`MovingFrameIntegratedNullity`) verbatim as its
hypothesis `hval` with `Gcd := genuineDiffCurvSection g s S`.

**Non-vacuity (the value rejects the degenerate `Gcd = 0` on a non-flat manifold — and is distinct from
the anchor's conclusion).** This is a *value equality* — a specific number — not the moving-frame
remainder orthogonality the anchor concludes, so it is genuine mathematical input (no
hypothesis-packaging). With `genuineDiffCurvSection g s S = 0` it would force
`⟨GcurvSection g s S, ∇S⟩_{L²} = ‖Δ_∇ S‖²_{L²} − ‖∇²S‖²_{L²}`, i.e. the pure-Riemann pairing alone
carries the whole Weitzenböck value; *false* on a non-flat manifold (`R ≠ 0`) for a non-parallel `S`,
where the differentiated-curvature `(∇R) S` content is genuinely missing from the pure-Riemann trace.
So the differentiated-curvature section `Gcd` genuinely carries the missing `(∇R) S` content. The body
is `sorry`; consumers transitively depend on `sorryAx`. -/
