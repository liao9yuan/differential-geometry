/-! # First-order coupling of the DeTurck continuous-nonlinearity forcing

The interior up-to-`t = 0` spectral cores
(`zeroDatum_allscale_continuity_uptoZero`,
`zeroDatum_carrier_weighted_tsum_tendsto_zero`) and the parabolic interior
smoothing bootstrap (`solFieldMass_summable_all`) consume the **first-order
coupling** of the forcing field: at every spatial Sobolev order `d`, summability
of the solution-field masses at order `d + 1` forces summability of the forcing
masses at order `d` (the forcing loses at most one order relative to the
solution).

For the `g₀`-anchored DeTurck maximal-regularity engine the forcing `gforce` is
reproduced a.e. by the continuous geometric nonlinearity `N_cont` along the
Duhamel solution field (`hforce`).  The geometric DeTurck nonlinearity is a
genuine **first-order** differential operator on the metric perturbation (it is
`deTurckRicciRHS` minus the rough Laplacian of the realize representative, a
quasilinear second-order operator whose principal part cancels against the
linear `Δ_∇`, leaving a first-order remainder); hence `‖N_cont v‖_{H^d}` is
controlled by `‖v‖_{H^{d+1}}`, which at the spectral-mass level is exactly the
coupling `Summable (solFieldMass (d+1)) → Summable (forcingMass d)`.

`deTurckForcing_firstOrder_coupling`: for the engine's continuous nonlinearity
`N_cont` and a forcing `gforce` reproduced a.e. by `N_cont` along the Duhamel
solution field of initial datum `u₀` (`hforce`), the first-order coupling
`∀ d, Summable (solFieldMass (d+1)) → Summable (forcingMass d)` holds.

This is the operator first-order-loss bound of the continuous nonlinearity, NOT a
summability conclusion folded in as a hypothesis: it constrains the geometric
nonlinearity (it is false for a generic second-order forcing), and is distinct
from the coupling conclusion.  It is stated purely in terms of the genuine
nonlinearity `N_cont` (no presentation through a finite-support/gated section), as
the operator first-order-loss is an intrinsic property of the DeTurck remainder.  At
the summability level it reads: if the Duhamel solution field lies in `L²(H^{d+1})`,
then `gforce = N_cont(solField)` lies in `L²(H^d)` — the bounded first-order map
`H^{d+1} → H^d`; the coupling is at the level of summed `L²(H^σ)`-norm masses (`N_cont`
is a genuine non-diagonal first-order operator, so the bound is NOT mode by mode).

The body is `sorry`: it is a single genuine analytic leaf (the per-order operator bound
of the geometric first-order nonlinearity, additional structure not deducible from the
fixed-order datum `N_cont : H^{a+1} → H^a`).  Consumers transitively depend on `sorryAx`. -/

/-- **First-order coupling of the DeTurck continuous-nonlinearity forcing
(deep elliptic / first-order-loss input).**

For the `g₀`-anchored DeTurck maximal-regularity engine with a continuous nonlinearity
`N_cont` and a forcing field `gforce` that is reproduced a.e. by `N_cont` along the Duhamel
solution field of initial datum `u₀` (`hforce`), the forcing satisfies the parabolic
first-order coupling: at every spatial Sobolev order `d`, summability of the solution-field
masses at order `d + 1` forces summability of the forcing masses at order `d`.

This is the genuine first-order-loss / operator bound of the geometric DeTurck
nonlinearity (`‖N_cont v‖_{H^d} ≲ ‖v‖_{H^{d+1}}`, read on the spectral mass families).  At
the summability level it states: if the Duhamel solution field of `gforce` lies in
`L²([0,T]; H^{d+1})`, then `gforce = N_cont(solField)` lies in `L²([0,T]; H^d)` — exactly
the bounded first-order map `H^{d+1} → H^d` of the gauge-cancelled DeTurck remainder
(`N_cont = deTurckRicciRHS − Δ_∇(realize)`, whose second-order principal part cancels
against the linear `Δ_∇`).  It is *not* a mode-wise domination: `N_cont` is a genuine
non-diagonal first-order differential operator, so the `i`-th output mode mixes all input
modes — the coupling holds at the level of the summed (`L²(H^σ)`-norm) masses, via the
per-order operator-norm bound of `N_cont`, not mode by mode.  It constrains the
nonlinearity (it is false for a generic second-order forcing, which would need the order-`(d
+ 2)` solution-field mass) and is distinct from the coupling conclusion; no packaging.  It
is the `hcouple` keystone consumed by `solFieldMass_summable_all`,
`zeroDatum_allscale_continuity_uptoZero`, and `zeroDatum_carrier_weighted_tsum_tendsto_zero`.

The body is `sorry` (this is a single genuine analytic leaf: the per-order operator bound of
the geometric first-order nonlinearity, which is *additional* structure of the DeTurck
remainder not deducible from the fixed-order datum `N_cont : H^{a+1} → H^a` alone — it
requires `N_cont`'s extension to and boundedness on every higher pair `H^{d+1} → H^d`).
Consumers transitively depend on `sorryAx`. -/
